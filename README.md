# Call-Thematic-Analysis
A comprehensive analysis done on agent-customer call transcripts using topic modelling techniques. The objective was to unveil critical topics, pain points, and ascertain customer concerns within the conversational data. 

To achieve this, various unsupervised learning models, including LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and K-means, were employed, complemented by the integration of advanced NLP
(Natural Language Processing) techniques. Multiple models were meticulously developed to ensure the robust extraction of valuable insights and topics from the dataset.
The insights and topics derived from this analytical endeavor have played a pivotal role in mining the actionable information. These findings have not only offered a
deeper understanding of customer-agent interactions but have also facilitated the formulation of data-driven decisions. This, in turn, paved way to a path of continuous improvement, fostering customer-centric strategies and enhancing overall customer experience.

Through this comprehensive analysis, the project has provided methods to optimize the business operational strategies, refine customer engagement practices, and align their efforts with the evolving needs and preferences of the organization's clientele. The utilization of topic modelling and NLP techniques has emerged as a valuable tool in uncovering latent patterns within agent-customer call transcripts, thereby contributing to data-informed decision-making and organizational advancement.
